At its centre is the tale of nobleman Jean Valjean, unfairly victimized by an unjust system. The younger character of Marius is based around Hugo&rsquo;s own experiences as an impoverished student.<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>The world&rsquo;s largest museum unsurprisingly also contains one of the world&rsquo;s finest collections of art and antiquities (up to 1848). To complete the superlatives, the building was once France&rsquo;s largest royal palace (see Mus&eacute;e du Louvre).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>This former railway station is one of the world&rsquo;s leading art galleries and, for many, reason alone to visit Paris (see Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_015_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Some six million visitors a year ascend to the top of this most famous Paris landmark for the spectacular views. It was erected for the Universal Exhibition of 1889 (see Eiffel Tower).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_016.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>This great Gothic cathedral, founded on the site of a Gallo-Roman temple, is a repository of French art and history. It also represents the geographical &ldquo;heart&rdquo; of France (see Notre-Dame).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_017.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>The terrace in front of this monumental white-domed basilica in Montmartre affords one of the finest free views over Paris (see Sacr&eacute;-Coeur).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_018.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Napoleon&rsquo;s triumphal arch, celebrating battle victories, stands proudly at the top of the Champs-Elys&eacute;es and, along with the Eiffel Tower, is one of the city&rsquo;s most enduring images (see Arc de Triomphe).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris006parhig_019_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Home to France&rsquo;s National Museum of Modern Art, the building itself is a work of contemporary art.

Before the Revolution this was a prime spot for the aristocracy to show off their latest fashions. The gardens are now part of the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre (see Jardin des Tuileries).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_015_add.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>A very Parisian walk, particularly on a Sunday, is along the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) of the Seine. The riverside quays of the Latin Quarter have been lined with second-hand bookstalls 
							(bouquinistes)
						 for centuries. The books are mostly in French, but you&rsquo;ll also find stalls selling prints and postcards.<br></p><p>Montmartre<br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_014_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>The steep streets of the Butte are a good place to get some exercise after indulging in the irresistible French cuisine. Although this famous artists&rsquo; quarter is more touristy than Bohemian these days, its old charms can still be found in the winding back streets and small squares (see Montmartre and Pigalle).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_016_add.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>With inspiring art galleries, delectable delis, and shop after shop filled with contemporary fashions and objets d&rsquo;art, a walk in the Marais is great fun, even if you only window-shop. The beautiful mansions are a great backdrop for your stroll and there are plenty of caf&eacute;s and bars for sustenance (see Marais and the Bastille).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_017_add.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>In this historic botanical garden you can escape the bustle of the city and lose yourself on the shady tree-lined avenues, amid colourful flowerbeds, or the hothouses and exotic gardens. Or simply relax on the lawns (see Jardin des Plantes).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_018_add.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Napoleon designated this the &ldquo;garden of children&rdquo;, and whether or not you have little ones in tow you&rsquo;ll enjoy a walk through this favourite haunt of the Latin Quarter. After you&rsquo;ve seen the octagonal pond and the Medicis Fountain, seek out the miniature Statue of Liberty and the statues of French queens (see Jardin du Luxembourg).<br></p><p><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_019_add.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Although you could walk end to end in about 10 minutes, the Seine&rsquo;s smaller island demands a more leisurely stroll. You&rsquo;ll discover superb little art galleries, trendy boutiques, and a village-like atmosphere within this up-market enclave (see Ile de la Cit&eacute; and Ile St-Louis).<br></p><p>Bois de Boulogne<br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_013_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>Come here at the weekend if you want to join the locals in the &ldquo;great escape&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;ll have 8.65 sq km (3.34 sq miles) from which to choose your path. The Bagatelle Gardens are a fine place for a walk in spring and summer, when a stunning array of roses and other flowers are in bloom (see Bois de Boulogne).<br></p><p>Boulevard St-Germain<br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>There&rsquo;s no better way to enjoy the Latin Quarter than to do as the Parisians do &ndash; stroll the Boulevard St-Germain, preferably late on a Sunday morning. After your walk, honour the birthplace of caf&eacute; society with a coffee at either Les Deux Magots or Caf&eacute; de Flore, two of the city&rsquo;s most famous literary and intellectual haunts.<br></p><p>Joan of Arc<br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris020famvis_012_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:90%;"><br>The French patriot Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc (1412&ndash;31), who defended her country against the invading English, had a posthumous trial here in 1455, despite having been burnt at the stake 24 years earlier.
