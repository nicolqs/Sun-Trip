The most famous feature is the adjoining convent&rsquo;s 18th-century majolica cloister (see Santa Chiara).<br></p><p><h2>San Francesco di Paola</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_napama040chunap_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>A rarity in Naples, this Neo-Classical structure imitates the Pantheon, Rome&rsquo;s great pagan temple to the gods built in the 2nd century AD. Inside and out the basilica is austere, with the exception of the polychrome marble Baroque altar (see San Francesco di Paola).<br></p><p><h2>Santa Lucia</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_napama040chunap_016.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>According to legend, a church dedicated to St Lucy was built here in ancient times, although experts date the earliest structure to the 9th century. Destroyed and rebuilt repeatedly, the present church is postwar. All the artworks were destroyed during World War II, save an 18th-century statue of St Lucy and a couple of paintings.<br></p><p><h2>Domed ceiling, Cappella di San Gennaro</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_napama012duonap_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Built in the 1600s, this Baroque extravaganza to the centre-right of the nave employed marble and precious metals and the great artists of the day to decorate its walls and ceiling.<br></p></div>
