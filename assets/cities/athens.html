As a preventative measure, he swallowed Metis whole, but the unborn child continued to grow in Zeus&rsquo;s head. After nine months, Hephaestus split open the god&rsquo;s head with an axe, and out sprung the girl goddess Athena, already in full armour.<br></p><h2>Theseus killing the Minotaur</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_athens038athleg_015_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>After a dispute between Aegeus and his brother Minos, King of Crete, Minos demanded Athens send regular tributes of 14 youths and maidens, who were sacrificed to the monstrous Minotaur.

The tyrant Polydectes violently desired Danae, but Perseus promised him the snake-infested head of Medusa in exchange for his mother&rsquo;s safety. Perseus slew Medusa with Athena&rsquo;s help and, upon his return, turned Polydectes to stone; Athena then put Medusa&rsquo;s head on her shield.<br></p></div>
