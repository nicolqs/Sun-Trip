Everyone worth knowing in Hong Kong is on its members&rsquo; list, but this means that it can be hard to gain access. Inspired by the Enlightenment concept of literary and discursive salons, Kee can sometimes be too arty by half, but it&rsquo;s always worth an invitation. Assuming you&rsquo;re lucky enough to score one.<br></p></div>
