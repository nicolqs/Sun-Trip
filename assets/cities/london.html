His satirical poem, London (1738), attacked poverty in the city and his parliamentary sketches and dictionary made him famous.<br></p><h2>Geoffrey Chaucer</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_london072litlon_012_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Chaucer (1343&ndash;1400) was a diplomat and son of a London vintner. His Canterbury Tales is a classic piece of English literature, and follows a group of pilgrims travelling from Southwark to Canterbury. In 17,000 lines the characters tell their rollicking tales.<br></p><h2>Waxwork Royalty, Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_london068chilon_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>One of London&rsquo;s most popular attractions, this is where you can see everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Queen. A Spirit of London ride takes you on a whistle-stop tour of the city&rsquo;s history. The famous Chamber of Horrors puts you face-to-face with London&rsquo;s most infamous criminals and has the very guillotine that beheaded Queen Marie Antoinette in the French Revolution. Other sections of the exhibition include Premiere Night, which is devoted to the giants of the entertainment world. Get there early to avoid waiting in long queues (see Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s).<br></p><h2>London Zoo</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_london068chilon_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>There&rsquo;s a full day out to be had in this 36-acre zoo. Home of the Zoological Society of London, the zoo emphasizes its important international role in conservation and research work. Its 
						enclosures have won awards, such as the aviary designed by Lord Snowdon. The Meet the Monkeys enclosure provides a rainforest habitat for free-roaming monkeys and other
wildlife (see London Zoo).<br></p></div>
