Just a few buildings survived, including the Historic Water Tower and Pumping Station.<br></p><h2>The Chicago White Sox in 1919</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_chicag034momchi_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The Chicago White Sox was a winning baseball team but poorly paid, so players sometimes fixed games, pocketing money from gamblers. After a group of players conspired to lose the 1919 World Series, eight of them were indicted, acquitted for insufficient evidence, but banned for life from baseball &ndash; and forever nicknamed the &ldquo;Black Sox.&rdquo;<br></p><h2>Al Capone</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_chicag034momchi_013_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>This brutal murder of seven of Al Capone&rsquo;s rival gangsters is one of history&rsquo;s most notorious massacres. Capone set up a sting that sent George &ldquo;Bugsy&rdquo; Moran&rsquo;s main men to a nearby garage. There, Capone&rsquo;s henchmen, dressed as police officers, lined them up and riddled them with bullets. Seven bushes now mark the spot (at Clark Street and Dickens Avenue).<br></p><h2>Navy Pier</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_chicag056kidchi_015_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Kids make a beeline for Navy Pier&rsquo;s old-fashioned carnival rides including a 10-storey Ferris Wheel and musical carousel. The ships that line the docks, from sleek, tall-masted schooners to powerful motor boats will also grab their attention. All the restaurants here are family friendly, and even the sculptures that line the Pier in summer are designed to withstand climbers.<br></p></div>
