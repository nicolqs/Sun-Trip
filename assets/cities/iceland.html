Upstairs, Iceland&rsquo;s settlement is covered in detail, from a pneumatic longship prow to impressions of how the islands looked then with more trees and no sheep. Downstairs, Egil&rsquo;s Saga is brought to life with depictions of key scenes from this violent tale (see Borgarnes Settlement Centre).<br></p><p><h2>A display at the Icelandic Emigration Centre</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_icelan062musaro_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The museum&rsquo;s lonely setting on the north coast, gives some idea of the feelings endured by the thousands of 19th-century Icelanders who left for Canada following a catastrophic series of harsh winters and volcanic eruptions.<br></p><p><h2>Sk&oacute;gar Museum</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_icelan062musaro_016.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The museum&rsquo;s collection documents over 1,000 years of life. There is a brass ring off a Viking treasure chest, traditional turf buildings, a Bible from 1584 (Iceland&rsquo;s first printed book), a fishing boat and clothing.<br></p><p><h2>Herring Era Museum</h2><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_icelan062musaro_018.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>A sleepy place today, Siglufj&ouml;r&eth;ur was &ndash; until fish stocks declined during the 1960s &ndash; the busiest herring port in the country, its harbour crammed with boats. The museum documents those hectic times in photos, models and dioramas, including photographs of the armies of &ldquo;herring girls&rdquo; who cleaned and salted the catches.<br></p></div>
