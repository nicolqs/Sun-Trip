Shady woodlands echo in summer to nightingales and cuckoos, and are full of butterflies tumbling through the air. The ascent steepens before the cluster of antenna prickling F&oacute;ia&rsquo;s summit come into view.<br></p><h2>Reserva Natural do Sapal nature trail</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_algarv050walalg_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The trail is around 6 km (3 miles) in length and two hours in duration, although ornithologists can spend all day in bliss scanning the reedbeds and salt marsh for plovers, avocets and other wading birds, plus many species of duck and gull. During the summer, visitors can also observe the salt harvest.<br></p><h2>Rocha da Pena, Penina circuit</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_algarv050walalg_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>A real hike in the hills that will appeal to the experienced hill walker. The region is a protec&shy;ted area of outstanding natural beauty and bristles with aromatic lavender and rosemary. Native cistus species are the dominant shrubs. The walk passes two ancient defensive walls and the Cave of the Moors.<br></p><h2>Benagil-Senhora da Rocha Clifftop trek</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_algarv050walalg_016.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Coastal erosion has eaten into the cliff face to produce some fantastic natural sculpture washed with a beautiful russet and mustard hue. The footpath, which is quite steep in places, looks over a series of delightful half-moon coves packed with golden sand. And there are ample spots to picnic in along the way.<br></p></div>
