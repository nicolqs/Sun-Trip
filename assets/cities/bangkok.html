While the town&rsquo;s reputation rests more on its nightlife than its golden sands, it boasts a reasonable stretch of beach and offers various watersports. Seafood and cold drinks hawkers stroll the shores.<br></p><h2>Jomtien Beach, Pattaya</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko052beanea_011.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The southernmost beach in Pattaya, Jomtien, is a bit quieter than the town&rsquo;s main beach but is backed by plenty of high-rise hotels, whose occupants sun themselves on this 9-mile (14-km) strip of sand. The beach has a reputation as Thailand&rsquo;s top windsurfing spot. Waterskiing, parasailing, and scuba diving are also on offer and there are several golf courses nearby.<br></p><h2>Mermaid statues at Hat Sai Kaeo</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko052beanea_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>An offshore island within easy reach of Bangkok, Koh Samed has inviting beaches, with superb clear water and soft sand. Hat Sai Kaeo, or Diamond Beach, is the longest and most-easily accessible beach on the island. It is also the busiest, with a string of resorts drawing in tourists. It is wise to avoid weekends when there is a shortage of accommodations.<br></p><h2>Traditional Thai house</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko016bancan_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Traditional Thai houses line the canals to the west of the Chao Phraya River. Set on stilts to avoid flooding, they usually have an open veranda and steeply pitched roofs to keep them cool.<br></p></div>
