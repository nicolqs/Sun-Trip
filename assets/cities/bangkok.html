While the town&rsquo;s reputation rests more on its nightlife than its golden sands, it boasts a reasonable stretch of beach and offers various watersports. Seafood and cold drinks hawkers stroll the shores.<br></p><h2>Jomtien Beach, Pattaya</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko052beanea_011.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The southernmost beach in Pattaya, Jomtien, is a bit quieter than the town&rsquo;s main beach but is backed by plenty of high-rise hotels, whose occupants sun themselves on this 9-mile (14-km) strip of sand. The beach has a reputation as Thailand&rsquo;s top windsurfing spot. Waterskiing, parasailing, and scuba diving are also on offer and there are several golf courses nearby.<br></p><h2>Mermaid statues at Hat Sai Kaeo</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko052beanea_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>An offshore island within easy reach of Bangkok, Koh Samed has inviting beaches, with superb clear water and soft sand. Hat Sai Kaeo, or Diamond Beach, is the longest and most-easily accessible beach on the island. It is also the busiest, with a string of resorts drawing in tourists. It is wise to avoid weekends when there is a shortage of accommodations.<br></p><h2>Traditional Thai house</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_bangko016bancan_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Traditional Thai houses line the canals to the west of the Chao Phraya River.
