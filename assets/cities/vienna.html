Among the 146 bodies resting in elaborately decorated sarcophagi or simple coffins are 12 emperors and 19 empresses. However, their hearts were buried separately in silver containers in the crypt of the Augustin church (see Augustinerkirche) and their intestines in copper urns in the catacombs of the Stephansdom.<br></p><h2>Michaelerkirche crypt</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_vienna062undvie_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>This crypt contains well-preserved mummies, some  still wearing Baroque frocks and wigs.
