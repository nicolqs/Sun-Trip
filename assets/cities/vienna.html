Filmed in the rubble of postwar Vienna, The Third Man is still remembered today as several tours follow in the footsteps of the characters.<br></p><h2>Kapuzinergruft</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_vienna062undvie_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The crypt beneath the Kapuzinerkirche (Capuchin church) was established by Empress Anna in 1618 and served as the Habsburgs&rsquo; burial place for more than 350 years. Among the 146 bodies resting in elaborately decorated sarcophagi or simple coffins are 12 emperors and 19 empresses. However, their hearts were buried separately in silver containers in the crypt of the Augustin church (see Augustinerkirche) and their intestines in copper urns in the catacombs of the Stephansdom.<br></p><h2>Michaelerkirche crypt</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_vienna062undvie_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>This crypt contains well-preserved mummies, some  still wearing Baroque frocks and wigs. From 1631 to 1784 some 4,000 bodies were buried here, including nobles who wanted to rest close to the emperor at his Hofburg residence  (see Michaelerkirche).<br></p><h2>Roman Ruins</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_vienna062undvie_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Remains of the Roman camp Vindobona (see Early Vienna) can be seen at this underground museum.
