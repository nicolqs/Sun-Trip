Two of the Palaces function as museums and are open to the public, while the other two are royal homes and remain closed. Queen Margrethe resides in Christian IX&rsquo;s Palace and Crown Prince Frederik in Frederik VIII&rsquo;s Palace. An interesting museum housed in Christian VIII&rsquo;s Palace includes reconstructed rooms from the 19th century. (see Amalienborg and Frederiksstaden).<br></p><h2>Rosenborg Slot</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_copenh058sigroy_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>This delightful, turreted Renaissance palace, built by Christian IV, is the oldest royal palace standing in its original form. It is also a depository for the crown jewels (see Rosenborg Slot and Kongens Have).<br></p><h2>Vor Frue Kirke, detail of fa&ccedil;ade</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_copenh058sigroy_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral has been a place of royal worship and ceremony since the 12th century, when Margrethe I married H&aring;kon IV of Norway. Since then, Christian I (1449) and Crown Prince Frederik (2004) have been married here and several princes have been crowned (see Vor Frue Kirke).<br></p><h2>Christiansborg Slot</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_copenh058sigroy_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>This is the seventh castle to have been built upon this site. The first, Bishop Absalon&rsquo;s fortified castle (1167), was destroyed in 1369. It has since been rebuilt several times. The castle built in 1730 was the first to be called Christiansborg; it was destroyed by fire 64 years later (see Christiansborg Slot).<br></p></div>
