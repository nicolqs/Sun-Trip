At its centre is the tale of nobleman Jean Valjean, unfairly victimized by an unjust system. The younger character of Marius is based around Hugo&rsquo;s own experiences as an impoverished student.<br></p><p><b>Jardin des Tuileries</b><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_012_r10_005.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>A stroll through the beautiful Tuileries Gardens is one of the must-dos of Paris. Before the Revolution this was a prime spot for the aristocracy to show off their latest fashions. The gardens are now part of the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre (see Jardin des Tuileries).<br></p><p><b>Montmartre</b><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_014_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The steep streets of the Butte are a good place to get some exercise after indulging in the irresistible French cuisine. Although this famous artists&rsquo; quarter is more touristy than Bohemian these days, its old charms can still be found in the winding back streets and small squares (see Montmartre and Pigalle).<br></p><p><b>Bois de Boulogne</b><br><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_paris050walpar_013_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Come here at the weekend if you want to join the locals in the &ldquo;great escape&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;ll have 8.65 sq km (3.34 sq miles) from which to choose your path. The Bagatelle Gardens are a fine place for a walk in spring and summer, when a stunning array of roses and other flowers are in bloom (see Bois de Boulogne).<br></p>
