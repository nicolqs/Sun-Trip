							increasingly the babouches found in the souks are made of a synthetic
							plastic that only looks like leather. In their most basic form they are
							pointy-toed and come in a variety of colours &ndash; canary yellow being the
							most common &ndash; but are otherwise plain. Increasingly however, boutiques and shops are customizing their babouches with silk trim, or even carving the
							leather with exquisite designs.<br></p><h2>Fruit of the argan tree</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_marrak016marsou_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Argan oil is an
							almost mystical substance to which all kinds of properties are attributed. Part of its mystique can be credited to the rarity of
							argan trees, which only grow in southwestern Morocco. The oil is sold
							all over the souks but much of it is low grade. For quality oil, it&rsquo;s
							best to buy from a reputable dealer.<br></p><h2>Pile of carpets in the Souk des Tapis</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_marrak016marsou_015.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Marrakech is famed for its carpets, made by the tribes of the south. Each
							tribe has its own patterns. Beware the salesmen&rsquo;s patter. Some carpets
							are very old and made of genuine cactus silk but these are rare. Most
							sold today, though beautiful, are quite modern and made from non-natural
							fibres. Buy a carpet if you like it, and not because you have been told
							that it&rsquo;s a good investment.<br></p><h2>Akkal ceramic</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_marrak016marsou_012.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>Each region of Morocco produces its own distinctive pottery. The local
							style is plain terracotta finished with colourful glazes. Ceramics from
							the Akkal factory would not look out of place in a cutting edge design
							shop. Or visit the big pottery souk outside Bab Ghemat which is to the
							southeast of the medina.<br></p></div>
