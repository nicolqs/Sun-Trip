Corridas (fights) take place in the Las Ventas stadium (capacity 25,000), which opened in 1931 and even has its own chapel and hospital. Officially the season runs from March to December but the real action begins in May with the Feria de San Isidro.<br></p><h2>Palacio Real</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_madrid046arcsig_013.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The Royal Palace marks a decisive break with the austere tastes of Spain&rsquo;s Habsburg rulers. Felipe V had been brought up at Versailles where the International Baroque style was in vogue. Architect Filippo Juvara died two years into the project, but his successor, Gian Battista Sacchetti retained the Baroque spirit (see Palacio Real).<br></p><h2>Plaza Mayor</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_madrid046arcsig_012_rep.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>The inspiration for the square was El Escorial&rsquo;s courtyard. But the plans of architect Juan de Herrera were only realized 30 years in 1619 later by G&oacute;mez de Mora (see Plaza Mayor).<br></p><h2>Metr&oacute;polis cupola</h2><p><img src="http://api.pearson.com/v2/travel/assets/tt_madrid046arcsig_014.jpg?apikey=bDpAVJlCztk9kPkLcfjqvAknoktNPGUp" style="width:100%;"><br>One of Madrid&rsquo;s signature buildings, Metr&oacute;polis was designed in 1905 by the French architects Jules and Raymond F&eacute;vrier. The high point literally of this lovely Neo-Baroque confection is the bronze wreaths garlanding the cupola, which glint in the sunlight.<br></p></div>
